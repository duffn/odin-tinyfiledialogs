# odin-tinyfiledialogs

[Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) bindings for [`tinyfiledialogs`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/).

## Usage

- Copy the `tinyfiledialogs` directory to your project.
- Import `tinyfiledialogs` and use the bindings.
- See the `example` directory for a simple example.

```
odin run example
```

## Status

- Only tested on macOS arm64. There are Linux libraries that I built but they are completley untested. I also plan to support Windows anand I'd be happy to have help testing these platforms.
- Most, but not all, `tinyfiledialogs` are currently working. The color picker is still a TODO.
